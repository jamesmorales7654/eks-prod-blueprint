# eks-prod-blueprint

> **Production-ready Amazon EKS infrastructure using modular Terraform**

This project provisions a scalable, secure, and production-grade Kubernetes cluster on AWS using Amazon EKS. The infrastructure is split into modular components (networking, IAM, and EKS) and follows best practices for multi-AZ deployment, IAM roles, NAT gateway usage, and remote state management.

---

## 📐 Architecture Overview

* **VPC with Public & Private Subnets** across 2 Availability Zones
* **Internet Gateway & NAT Gateway** for controlled egress
* **Private EKS Cluster** with managed node group
* **IAM roles for cluster and nodes** with least privilege policies
* **Remote state backend** using S3 and DynamoDB for state locking
